# Things I still want to do/add

(somewhat in order of priority)

- Improve README with build instructions
- Kafka SCSt Application codegen
- Codegen button for EventAPIs and API Products
- When viewing schema in plugin, add details on left like: Domain, App, Version, Name, etc.
- Track/store relative sizes of columns (when resize, trigger something that puts into datastore, need relative in case of resolution / size change
- Put token into vault rather than just datastore?
- Rabbit SCSt Application codegen
- Generic JMS Applicaiton codegen
