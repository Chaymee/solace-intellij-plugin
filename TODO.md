# Things I still want to do/add


- When viewing schema in plugin, add details like: Domain, App, Version, Name, etc.
- Track/store relative sizes of columns (when resize, trigger something that puts into datastore, need relative in case of resolution / size change
- Put token into vault rather than just datastore?
- Codegen button for EventAPIs and API Products
- Kafka Application codegen
- Rabbit Application codegen
