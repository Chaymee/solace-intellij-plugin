# Things I still want to do/add

(somewhat in order of priority)

- Improve README with build instructions
- In schema text view, make scroll pane keep caret within view when using curor keys off-screen
- Update the Wrapper with better error handling issues
- Kafka SCSt Application codegen
- Codegen button for EventAPIs and API Products
- When viewing schema in plugin, add details on left like: Domain, App, Version, Name, etc.
- Publish plugin to JetBrains marketplace (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/publishing-plugin.html?from=IJPluginTemplate)
   - Read about plugin signing
   - Sign up for Access Token
   - Read about Optimizing for Marketplace
- Track/store relative sizes of columns (when resize, trigger something that puts into datastore, need relative in case of resolution / size change
- Filter and/or Sort for objects
- Change Col 1 & Col 2 to be the same thing... and then make "View in Portal" another buttom or something
- Put EP token into local vault rather than just local datastore?
